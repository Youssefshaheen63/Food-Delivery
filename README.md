## Firebase Configuration
This project utilizes Firebase services for authentication and database. Follow these steps to set up Firebase for your project:

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2. In the project settings, find your Firebase configuration (apiKey, authDomain, databaseURL, projectId, storageBucket, messagingSenderId, appId).
3. Copy the configuration and replace the placeholders in `src/firebase/config.js` with your Firebase configuration.

## Running the Project
Once you have set up Firebase, you can run the project locally. Use the following command to start the development server:

This will start the development server and open the website in your default web browser. You can now explore the food delivery website and its features.
